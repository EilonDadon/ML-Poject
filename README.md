# ML Project: Donation Analysis for Israel

This project analyzes donation trends to Israel and predicts donation purposes using machine learning techniques. It also performs clustering to identify NGOs with similar donation characteristics.

## Objectives

1. **Analyze donation trends** by years and quarters.
2. **Predict donation purposes** based on donation details using supervised learning models.
3. **Identify clusters** of NGOs with similar donation characteristics through unsupervised learning.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and cleaning data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating relevant features for analysis and prediction.
- **Supervised Learning Models:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and KNN.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** K-means clustering for NGO grouping.
- **Visualization:** Donation trends, feature importance, and clustering results.
