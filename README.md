ML Project: Donation Analysis for Israel

This project analyzes donation trends to Israel and predicts donation purposes using machine learning techniques. It also performs clustering to identify NGOs with similar donation characteristics.

Objectives

Analyze donation trends by years and quarters.

Predict donation purposes based on donation details using supervised learning models.

Identify clusters of NGOs with similar donation characteristics through unsupervised learning.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and cleaning data.

Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features for analysis and prediction.

Supervised Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and KNN.

Unsupervised Learning: K-means clustering for NGO grouping.

Visualization: Donation trends, feature importance, and clustering results.
